                        <p class="lead">
                            This project examines the cause and effect of air quality and CO2 emissions 
                            in the United States. By showing the impact that air quality can have on health 
                            and other factors, this project argues that more strides should be taken to reduce
                            carbon emissions. This project analyzes factors that cause air pollution such as carbon emissions 
                            from industrial facilities, and correlated effects of poor air quality like 
                            respiratory disease. The scope of the project is within the United States.

                        <p class="lead">
                            The goal of this project is to inspire action. Traditionally, people do not 
                            personalize the consequences of certain phenomena because they think it does 
                            not concern them. Thus, we hope to tell a story about how the 
                            distribution of chronic respiratory illness can be correlated to air quality,  
                            the locations of facilities outputting greenhouse gasses, and socioeconomic status. 
                            We aim to develop an argument in which facilities that produce high 
                            levels of greenhouse gasses are unjustly placed in low income communities. 
                            As we explore this correlation by comparing socioeconomic status to the locations 
                            of facilities outputting greenhouse gas, we hope to highlight the correlation 
                            of wealth inequality affecting health outcomes 
                            while focusing on the geospatial relationships of these variables.

                        <p class="lead"> The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has developed the Air Quality 
                            Index, or AQI that ranges from 0 to 500. The AQI is divided into six categories varying 
                            by severity of health concern. An AQI value over 300 represents hazardous air quality and 
                            below 50 the air quality is good. EPA establishes an AQI for five major air pollutants regulated 
                            by the Clean Air Act. Each of these pollutants has a national air quality standard set 
                            by EPA to protect public health: ground-level ozone, particle pollution (also known as particulate matter, including PM2.5 and PM10), 
                            carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, and nitrogen dioxide</p>

                            Understanding the causes of air pollution is a step towards knowing how to stop further 
                            pollution. According to the EPA, 24% of greenhouse gas emissions in 2020 came from the 
                            industrial sector (EPA, 2020). Examining where these facilities are located can be useful for examining 
                            the geographical relationship between air quality and polluting factories. The map below shows 
                            where polluting factories are located in the United States by a proportional symbol 
                            representative of how much emissions are coming from each facility. Facilities with higher 
                            emissions are represented by larger symbols.

                        <p class="lead">
                            Poor air quality can leave harmful effects for the people who experience it. With the increase 
                            in greenhouse gasses, ozone levels, and poor air quality over time, we have also seen a 
                            rise in chronic respiratory disease mortality rates. Chronic respiratory diseases 
                            affect the airways and structures of the lungs, leaving people with coughing, wheezing, 
                            and difficulty breathing. Air pollution is a prominent risk factor for chronic respiratory 
                            diseases, and people with conditions like asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease 
                            may find their condition worsening in areas of high air pollution.
