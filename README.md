# Air Quality in the United States
Geog 458 Final Project \
June 8, 2022 \
Team AC3 Members: Bennett Olsen, Emily Eckey, Michael Tam, Ryan Singh, Trevor Nguyen 

## Project Introduction
Our final project looks at the cause and effect of air quality and CO2 emissions in the United States. By showing the impact that air quality can have on health and other factors, this project argues that more strides should be taken to reduce carbon emissions. To address what the root cause of the air quality issue is, this project analyzes factors that cause air pollution such as carbon emissions from industrial facilities, and correlated effects of poor air quality like respiratory disease. To deliver our opinion on the relationship, we use a storymap as our project format. The project includes six pages: a title page to introduce the topic, 4 storymaps on cause and effect, a page about our team and to cite our data sources and give acknowledgement. The scope of the project will be within the United States.

## Project Goal, Significance, and Broader Impacts
We hope for our project to identify the impact of poor air quality in general and where in the United States people are experiencing its worst effects. Once our project establishes the causes, correlates, and locations of poor air quality, legislators and regulatory agencies would be able to enact restrictions on industry and vehicular emissions. Depending on how our project informs legislators, there are many different approaches that can be taken to try and reduce emissions. Some possible solutions may put restrictions on businesses and negatively impact the economy if businesses need to invest more into reducing their emissions. The qualification of this as a negative impact depends on whether the audience views the economic impact of emission regulation as not with the improvement in air quality.

If our project isn’t put into context with other factors in society, some people might attribute the correlations we highlight strictly to air pollution. This means that people could neglect other causes of chronic respiratory disease and areas of lower income. We will try to avoid people coming to this conclusion by keeping our descriptions and insights within the frame of air quality, reminding viewers that air quality is only one aspect of poor respiratory health, and poor air quality isn’t the only issue that low income communities face.

The significance of our project is to inspire action. We hope to tell a story about how the distribution of chronic respiratory illness can be correlated to air quality, socioeconomic status and the locations of facilities outputting greenhouse gasses. We aim to develop an argument in which facilities that produce high levels of greenhouse gasses are unjustly placed in low income communities. We explore this correlation by comparing socioeconomic status to the locations of facilities outputting greenhouse gas. We hope to highlight the correlation of wealth inequality affecting health outcomes while focusing on the geospatial relationships of these variables. 

An unintended consequence of our project is if people misinterpret that correlation does not imply causation. We solely aim to explore the correlation between health outcomes and our predicted variables of socioeconomic status, AQI index, and facilities by location. We intend to communicate that there may be many other variables that we need to consider, and we would like to preface that that we are not oversimplifying this phenomenon. 

## Target Audience
The target audience consists of climate activists, the general public, governments, and legislators in states where air quality is significantly worse and progress needs to be made. Maps that show the correlation between poor air quality and other determinants of negative respiratory health and environmental effects would be helpful in convincing policy-makers to invest in improving air quality and regulate businesses that contribute to air pollution. Climate activists would also be able to access our project on the internet to achieve goals that are similar to our own.

## Data Sources
The map 1 data source is from the [EPA](https://www.epa.gov/outdoor-air-quality-data/air-quality-statistics-report) and introduces air pollution data in the United States and the measurement of AQI. It analyzes counties with the worst air pollution in 2020 and 2010.

The map 2 data source is from the [EPA](https://ghgdata.epa.gov/ghgp/main.do#/facility/?q=Find%20a%20Facility%20or%20Location&st=&bs=&et=&fid=&sf=11001100&lowE=-20000&highE=23000000&g1=1&g2=1&g3=1&g4=1&g5=1&g6=0&g7=1&g8=1&g9=1&g10=1&g11=1&g12=1&s1=1&s2=1&s3=1&s4=1&s5=1&s6=1&s7=1&s8=1&s9=1&s10=1&s201=1&s202=1&s203=1&s204=1&s301=1&s302=1&s303=1&s304=1&s305=1&s306=1&s307=1&s401=1&s402=1&s403=1&s404=1&s405=1&s601=1&s602=1&s701=1&s702=1&s703=1&s704=1&s705=1&s706=1&s707=1&s708=1&s709=1&s710=1&s711=1&s801=1&s802=1&s803=1&s804=1&s805=1&s806=1&s807=1&s808=1&s809=1&s810=1&s901=1&s902=1&s903=1&s904=1&s905=1&s906=1&s907=1&s908=1&s909=1&s910=1&s911=1&si=&ss=&so=0&ds=E&yr=2020&tr=current&cyr=2020&ol=0&sl=0&rs=ALL) and shows 2020 GHG emissions from large facilities in million metric tons CO2e. The primary function of this map is to identify locations of high GHG emissions and the facilities they come from. 

The map 3 data source is from [Global Health Data Exchange](https://ghdx.healthdata.org/record/ihme-data/united-states-chronic-respiratory-disease-mortality-rates-county-1980-2014) and shows United States Chronic Respiratory Disease Mortality Rates by County 1980-2014. 

The map 4 data source is from [ArcGIS REST Services Directory](https://services1.arcgis.com/4yjifSiIG17X0gW4/arcgis/rest/services/SES_indicators/FeatureServer/1) and shows census tracts with their unemployment rates.
